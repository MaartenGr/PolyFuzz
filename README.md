**`PolyFuzz`** performs fuzzy string matching, string grouping, and contains extensive evaluation functions. 
PolyFuzz is meant to bring fuzzy string matching techniques together within a single framework.

Currently, methods include Levenshtein distance with RapidFuzz, a character-based n-gram TF-IDF, word embedding
techniques such as FastText and GloVe, and finally ðŸ¤— transformers embeddings. 

You can use your own **custom models** for both the fuzzy string matching as well as the string grouping.

## 1. Getting Started
[Back to ToC](#toc)

```python
from polyfuzz import PolyFuzz

from_list = ["apple", "apples", "appl", "recal", "house", "similarity"]
to_list = ["apple", "apples", "mouse"]

model = PolyFuzz("TF-IDF").match(from_list, to_list)

```  

The resulting topics can be accessed through `model.get_matches()`:

```python
>>> model.get_matches()
         From      To  Similarity
0       apple   apple    1.000000
1      apples  apples    1.000000
2        appl   apple    0.783751
3       recal    None    0.000000
4       house   mouse    0.587927
5  similarity    None    0.000000

```
