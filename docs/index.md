# PolyFuzz
<img src="logo.png">

**`PolyFuzz`** performs fuzzy string matching, string grouping, and contains extensive evaluation functions. 
PolyFuzz is meant to bring fuzzy string matching techniques together within a single framework.

Currently, methods include Levenshtein distance with RapidFuzz, a character-based n-gram TF-IDF, word embedding
techniques such as FastText and GloVe, and ðŸ¤— transformers embeddings. 

The philosophy of PolyFuzz is: `Easy to use yet highly customizable`. It is a string matcher tool that requires only 
a few lines of code but that allows you customize and create your own models. 


## Installation
You can install **`PolyFuzz`** via pip:
 
```
pip install polyfuzz
```

This will install the base dependencies and excludes any deep learning/embedding models. 

If you want to be making use of ðŸ¤— Transformers, install the additional additional `Flair` dependency:

```
pip install polyfuzz[flair]
```
